A few things:
-------------

ORGANIZATION
------------
Nothing too complicated here.
Just make sure you're using TortoiseSVN and follow the Subversion rules.
Please keep the trunk organized -- don't just dump random files in it -- use folders.

COMMITTING
----------
Make sure you comment every commit. Subversion's commits are both batched and atomic, so any files you added, any files you changed, any files you deleted, any files you renamed, any directories you added or deleted or renamed, will all show up on the server all at once, as a single revision and a single checkin, the next time you right-click and select "SVN Commit".

In case you forget the server IP/connection statement: 
svn://152.23.193.101/ifold/trunk/

In case you forget your username/password, just IM me.
